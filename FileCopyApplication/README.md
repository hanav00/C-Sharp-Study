# File Copy Application

This is a simple Windows Forms application that allows you to copy files from one location to another with progress tracking.

## Features

- Copy files asynchronously
- Track progress with a progress bar and elapsed time tracking
- Copy files in synchronous mode
- Reset the application
- Adjust window transparency using the mouse wheel


## How to Use

1. Download the executable (EXE) file from the [Releases](link-to-releases) section.
2. Run the application by double-clicking the EXE file.
3. Select the source and target files using the "Source" and "Target" buttons.
4. Click the "Async Copy" button to copy files asynchronously with progress tracking.
5. Click the "Sync Copy" button to copy files synchronously.
6. Use the mouse wheel to adjust the window transparency.
7. Click the "Reset" button to clear the form.


## Exception Handling

- If the source or target file does not exist, the application will display a message indicating that the file does not exist.
- If the file extensions of the source and target files are different, a warning message will be displayed. Copying files with different extensions may result in file corruption. The user will be prompted to confirm whether to proceed with the copy operation.
